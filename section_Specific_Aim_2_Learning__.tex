\section{Specific Aim 2: Learning by Example}

Address 2 challenges:
\begin{itemize}
\item resolving user input to create a final image, based on training data
\begin{itemize}
\item create a probability image weighted by how well each user did on the training data
\item joint fusion strategy?
\end{itemize}
\item predicting regions of variability to serve more efficiently
\begin{itemize}
\item can we predict which voxels are "controversial" and only show those?
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
