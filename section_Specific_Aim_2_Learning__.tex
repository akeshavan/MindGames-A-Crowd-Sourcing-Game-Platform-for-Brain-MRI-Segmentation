\section{Specific Aim 2: Learning by Example}
This aim will address 3 challenges: 1) Resolve user input to create a final 3D volume, 2) Strategize which micro-tasks are served more frequently based on user input variability and 3) Predict the user-edited segmentation image. To resolve the micro-tasks back into a 3D image, a weighted consensus map will be computed based on how accurately each user performed edits on training data. Micro-tasks with lower consensus scores will be served more frequently to users, until the consensus is high. Participants will also be scored based on how well they match with the consensus image. 


Address 2 challenges:
\begin{itemize}
\item resolving user input to create a final image, based on training data
\begin{itemize}
\item create a probability image weighted by how well each user did on the training data
\item joint fusion strategy?
\end{itemize}
\item predicting regions of variability to serve more efficiently
\begin{itemize}
\item can we predict which voxels are "controversial" and only show those?
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
