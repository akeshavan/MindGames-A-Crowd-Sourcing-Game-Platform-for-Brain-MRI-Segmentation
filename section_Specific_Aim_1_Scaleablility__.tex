\begin{itemize}
\item training: how frequently does training data need to be used
\begin{itemize}
\item need to signal to users that this is being verified, avoid malicious users, increase time and care spent on task
\item also keep track of time spent on task. If many voxels were erased, were they erased quickly or slowly. 
\end{itemize}
\item UI edit, gamify
\begin{itemize}
\item already have mindcontrol platform to do editing
\item give badges relative to volume of voxels edited, reward training with points for feedback
\item use amazon turk's api rather than the turk platform itself. 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
