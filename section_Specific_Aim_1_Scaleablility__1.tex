\section{Specific Aim 1: Scaleablility and Security}
EyeWire game had over 200,000 users, so our solution needs to scale well. 
We will address 2 key challenges:
\begin{itemize}
\item data management, handling large datasets, distributed computing 
\begin{itemize}
\item need to learn how to use Amazon, spark, distributed computing. Resources at the eScience institute will help. 
\item learn how to connect to amazon turk for paid incentive, zooniverse for free
\end{itemize}
\item serving piece-wise "chunks" of data rather than the whole dataset. This preserves privacy if the data is not open, and reduces the fatigue of users. Need to serve intelligently to figure out which pieces to serve next.
\item show different views: axial, coronal, sagittal
\begin{itemize}
\item different datasets will need to be chunked differently. Lesions need all 3 slices view but brain mask editing, only 1. Needs to be user-specified, to answer the question "how much chunking is necessary for this application"
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
