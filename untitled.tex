\section*{Rationale}

Advances in MRI technology and image segmentation algorithms have enabled researchers to begin to understand the mechanisms of healthy brain development \cite{giedd1999brain} and neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis \cite{bakshi2008mri}. Due to the large variability of brain morphology, increasingly large sample sizes are needed to answer important biomedical questions. In order to make sense of all the information, automated algorithms were developed to reduce information-rich 3D MRI images to 1 dimensional summary metrics describing tissue properties, such as total gray matter volume, that are easier to understand. Automated  segmentation algorithms save a lot of time compared to manual human inspection, but lack the advanced visual system of humans. As a result, they often make systematic errors, especially when analyzing brains with pathology, or those in the early stages of development. Data science is poised to help answer neuroscience research questions using a crowd-sourcing strategy, where errors from automatic quantification can be resolved efficiently by non-expert "citizen-scientists".

Crowdsourcing has been successful in many other disciplines, including mathematics, astronomy, and biochemistry \cite{wiggins2011conservation}. Recently, over 200,000 "citizen-neuroscientists"  from over 147 countries helped identify neuronal connections in a mouse retina through the Eyewire game \cite{kim2014space}. This crowd-sourced game led to a new understanding of how mammalian retinal cells detect motion. I propose to implement three key features of the EyeWire paradigm and adapt them for multiple neuroimaging uses. First, by breaking up the problem into smaller "micro-tasks", scientists were able to access a much larger user-pool of non-experts \cite{kittur2008crowdsourcing}. Second, machine learning algorithms were trained to help with the task, which improved the speed of manual neuronal tracing and validated non-expert input. Lastly, EyeWire transformed a dull, monotonous task for experts into a fun, competitive game that trained non-experts and acquired valuable scientific data. I propose to implement these features to create an open-source platform for efficiently crowd-sourcing brain tissue classification problems in order to answer neuroscience research questions with more precision.
