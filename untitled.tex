\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item Importance of quantification of MRI in understanding brain-behavior relationships and disease
\item Large diversity of people, their brains, both normally and from disease, means we need to collect large datasets = "big data"
\item To comprehend all the data we collect, we reduce 3D or 4D images that are rich with information to 1D scalar "features", such as "brain size" with automated algorithms
\item But automated algorithms don't have the rich visual system of humans, they make mistakes, especially for brains with pathology or early in development
\item Data science can help with biomedical/clinical research by transforming a research question into a crowd-sourced solution. 
\item I propose an open platform that can be adapted to different use cases around the following core concepts/specific aims.
\end{itemize}

\section{Specific Aims}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Scaleablity and Security: A database system and server backend that keeps data private by piece-wise exposure
\item Learning by Example: Machine learning tool that learns from human curation
\item Training and Gamification: User interface that trains users to solve a specific problem to solve, and keeps them engaged to keep solving
\end{enumerate}

\section{Specific Aim 1: Scaleablility and Security}

We will address 2 key challenges:
\begin{itemize}
\item data management, handling large datasets, distributed computing. 
\begin{itemize}
\item need to learn how to use Amazon, spark, distributed computing
\end{itemize}
\item serving piece-wise "chunks" of data rather than the whole dataset. This preserves privacy if the data is not open, and reduces the fatigue of users. Need to serve intelligently to figure out which pieces to serve next.
\begin{itemize}
\item different datasets will need to be chunked differently. Lesions need all 3 slices view but brain mask editing, only 1.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Specific Aim 2: Learning by Example}

Address 2 challenges:
\begin{itemize}
\item resolving user input to create a final image
\item predicting regions of variability to serve more efficiently
\end{itemize}
