\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item Importance of quantification of MRI in understanding brain-behavior relationships and disease
\item Large diversity of people, their brains, both normally and from disease, means we need to collect large datasets = "big data"
\item To comprehend all the data we collect, we reduce 3D or 4D images that are rich with information to 1D scalar "features", such as "brain size" with automated algorithms
\item But automated algorithms don't have the rich visual system of humans, they make mistakes, especially for brains with pathology or early in development
\item Data science can help with biomedical/clinical research by transforming a research question into a crowd-sourced solution
\end{itemize}
