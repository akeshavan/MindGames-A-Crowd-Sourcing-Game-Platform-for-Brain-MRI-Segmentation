\subsection*{Specific Aim 2: Learning by Example}
This aim will address 3 challenges: 1) Resolve user input to create a final 3D volume, 2) Strategize which micro-tasks to serve more frequently based on user consensus and 3) Predict the user-edited segmentation image. To reconstruct the micro-tasks back into a 3D image, a weighted consensus map will be computed based on how accurately each user performed edits on training data. Micro-tasks with lower consensus scores will be served more frequently to users, until the consensus is high. Participants will also be scored based on how well they match with the consensus image, which will be used to reward users in aim 3. Finally, improving automated segmentation algorithms based on human input would save time and reduce the number of editors assigned each micro-task. I propose to build a convolutional neural network to predict segmentation results, under the guidance of the machine learning experts at the eScience institute.
