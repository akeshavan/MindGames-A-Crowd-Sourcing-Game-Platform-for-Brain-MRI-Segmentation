\subsubsection*{Specific Aim 1: Scaleable and Secure Micro-Tasks}

This aim will address two key challenges: 1) Partitioning 3D data into microtasks that keep data private, 2) serving micro-tasks at scale. While there exists many large-scale open-source data collection efforts, many datasets are kept private within research institutions due to  IRB restrictions, so presenting a full 3D MRI volume to the public would be a violation. Serving smaller "chunks" of data serves two purposes: it allows us to keep data private (because you cannot see the whole brain) and reduces the fatigue of non-experts (because you only need to edit a small section), which enables us to engage a larger user-base. A scaleable server will be implemented on the Amazon cloud, with an API that allows researchers to upload MRI micro-tasks to the server database, and serves microtasks. Researchers will be asked to provide the following to the API: 1) an initial segmentation file from an automated algorithm 2) any original images (T1, T2, PD) that  users need to properly edit the segmentation 3) to specify how the images should be sliced (including the slicing plane and the number of slices) into microtasks. Additionally, researchers must provide a validation dataset, which includes "correctly" segmented images, which will be used to train non-experts in aim 3. The resources and faculty at the eScience institute will help me to implement state-of-the-art database and cloud computing technology in order to increase the delivery of micro-tasks to "citizen-scientists".
